## Description
> This project will be developing a bookstore for users to order a selection of books from, and for admins to be able to track orders.
> Allows customers to have their books delivered to them with ease!
> Once you create an account for our online bookstore, you will have the ability to browse categories and best-sellers, or seach up
> their preferred books individually. They are able to see all the information about that book (author, description, identifiers),
> and read other users reviews about said book, as well as see every order they have ever placed.
> Admins will be able to manage categories and reviews, deleting any inappropriate ones (could also set up a profanity filter).
> Admins also have the ability of tracking an order's status, seeing how far into the process it has came.
